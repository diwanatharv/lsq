<!--HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to specify what action is to be performed on a particular resource.
 The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
  These are equivalent to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).-->

<!--GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server.
GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server.-->

<!--POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server.
 On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201.-->

<!--PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server.
It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload.
If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.-->

<!--PATCH: PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data.
 It will only replace the content that you want to update.-->

<!--DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.-->
